Data Transfer Nodes (DTNs)

.. _dtn-system-overview:

System Overview
===============
The Data Transfer Nodes ("DTNs"; ``dtn.ccs.ornl.gov``) are hosts specifically
designed to provide optimized data transfer between OLCF systems and systems
outside of the OLCF network. These nodes perform well on local-area transfers
as well as the wide-area data transfers for which they are tuned. The OLCF
recommends that users use these nodes to improve transfer speed and reduce load
on computational systemsâ€™ login and service nodes.

.. _dtn-access-connecting:

Access & Connecting
===================
DTN access is automatically granted to all enabled OLCF users.

To connect to the DTNs, SSH to ``dtn.ccs.ornl.gov``. For example:

::

    ssh username@dtn.ccs.ornl.gov

For more information on connecting to OLCF resources, see
:ref:`connecting-to-olcf`.
