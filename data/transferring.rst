Data Transfer 
===============

Many users would like to transfer their data from or to Summit through Globus, but their institute does not provide a globus infrastructure. In the following instructions, you can learn how to create your own Globus endpoint. We don't know if or when globus will not support this approach anymore. 

How to use Globus from my laptop
--------------------------------

``scp`` and ``rsync`` are available on Summit for small remote
transfers. For larger remote transfers with Alpine, we recommend using Globus to do the remote transfer.

Â  Follow the steps:

-  Visit https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal and Install Globus Connect Personal, it is available foe Windows, Mac, and Linux

- Selecting the appropriate link there are detailed instructions about the installation, for example, for Mac: https://docs.globus.org/how-to/globus-connect-personal-mac/
- Remember the name of the endpoint that you declared, in this example, the endpoint is *laptop_gmarkom*

- When the installation has finished, click on the globus icon and select *Web: Transfer Files* as below
