Data Transfer
===============


Using common terminal tools
---------------------------

In general, when transferring data into or out of the OLCF from the command
line, it's best to initiate the transfer from outside the OLCF. If moving many
small files, it can be beneficial to compress them into a single archive file,
then transfer just the one archive file. 

``scp`` and ``rsync`` are available for remote transfers.

* ``scp`` 

	* Sending a file to OLCF

	.. code::

   	   scp yourfile $USER@dtn.ccs.ornl.gov:/path/


	* Retrieving a file from OLCF

	.. code::

   	   scp $USER@dtn.ccs.ornl.gov:/path/yourfile .


	* Sending a directory to OLCF

	.. code::

   	   scp -r yourdirectory $USER@dtn.ccs.ornl.gov:/path/


* ``rsync``


	* Sync a directory named ``mydir`` from your local system to the OLCF

	.. code::

   	   rsync -avz mydir/ $USER@dtn.ccs.ornl.gov:/path/


	where:

  		* a is for archive mode\
  		* v is for verbose mode\
  		* z is for compressed mode\


	* Sync a directory from the OLCF to a local directory

	.. code::

   	   rsync -avz  $USER@dtn.ccs.ornl.gov:/path/dir/ mydir/

        * Transfer data and show progress while transferring

        .. code::

           rsync -avz --progress mydir/ $USER@dtn.ccs.ornl.gov:/path/

	* Include files or directories starting with T and exclude all others

        .. code::

           rsync -avz --progress --include 'T*' --exclude '*' mydir/ $USER@dtn.ccs.ornl.gov:/path/

	* If the file or directory exists at the target but not on the source, then delete it

        .. code::

           rsync -avz --delete $USER@dtn.ccs.ornl.gov:/path/ .

	* Transfer only the files that are smaller than 1MB

        .. code::

           rsync -avz --max-size='1m' mydir/ $USER@dtn.ccs.ornl.gov:/path/

	* If you want to verify the behavior is as intended, execute a dry-run

        .. code::

           rsync -avz --dry-run mydir/ $USER@dtn.ccs.ornl.gov:/path/

For more information execute:

.. code::

   man scp
   man rsync


* Differences:
	* ``scp`` cannot continue if it is interrupted. ``rsync`` can.
	* ``rsync`` is optimized for performance.
	* By default, ``rsync`` checks if the transfer of the data was successful.


Using Globus from your local machine
------------------------------------

Many users would like to transfer their data from or to Summit through Globus,
but their institute does not provide a globus infrastructure. In the following
instructions, you can learn how to create your own Globus endpoint. We don't
know if or when globus will not support this approach anymore.

Â  Follow these steps:

- Visit https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal and Install Globus
  Connect Personal, it is available foe Windows, Mac, and Linux

- Selecting the appropriate link there are detailed instructions about the
  installation, for example, for Mac:
  https://docs.globus.org/how-to/globus-connect-personal-mac/
- Remember the name of the endpoint that you declared, in this example, the
  endpoint is *laptop_gmarkom*

- When the installation has finished, click on the globus icon and select *Web:
  Transfer Files* as below

   :align: center

- Globus will ask you to login, choose the *Sign in with Google*

.. image:: /images/globus_google.png
   :align: center

- Now you are in the main globus web page, we select two panels (up right), we
  declare left the endpoint of the laptop and on the right the *OLCF DTN* (the
  order does not matter) and

   :align: center

- Then navigate to the appropriate paths to select the files you want to tranfer

- Then an activity report will appear and you can click on it to see
   the status. When the transfer is finished or failed, you will receive
   an email

-  You can see the status when you click to the activity report
