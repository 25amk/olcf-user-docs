Spock
################################################

This example is intended for use on Spock.

Purpose
------------------------------------------------

This guide meant as an example for a user to setup a Spack environment for application development using the OLCF 
provided files as a template.

.. warning::

  The provided ``spack.yaml`` files are templates for a user to use as an example.  The software environment is 
  under active development.

The provided Spack environment files are intended to assist OLCF users in setup their development environment at the 
OLCF.  The base environment file includes the compilers and packages that are installed at the system level.

Traditionally, the user environment is modified by module files, so a user would add use  ``module load cmake/3.18.2`` to 
load CMake version 3.18.2 into their environment.  Using a Spack environment, a user can add an OLCF provided package
and build against it using Spack without having to load the module file separately.

The information presented here is a subset of what can be found at `the Spack documentation site <https://spack.readthedocs.io/>`_.

.. note::
  Definitions

  - Spack environment - A set of Spack specs for the purpose of building, rebuilding and deploying in a coherent fashion.

  - External packages - An externally-installed package used by Spack, rather than building its own package.

  - Chained instance - A Spack instance that uses any packages installed 

Getting Started
------------------------------------------------

Clone the OLCF User Environment repo and the Spack repo, start a new Spack instance, and create and activate a new Spack environment:

.. code-block:: none

  ## From a Spock login

  > git clone https://code.ornl.gov/2ff/olcf-user-environments.git
  > cd olcf-user-environments

  > git clone https://github.com/spack/spack.git
  > source spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh

  > spack env create my_env linux-sles15-zen2/spock/spack.yaml
  > spack env activate my_env

Now a user can add and install their dependencies with Spack and proceed with developing their application.

Chained Spock Instances
------------------------------------------------

The Spock Spack environment includes this configuration addition:

.. code-block:: none

  upstreams:
    olcf:
      install_tree: /sw/spock/spack-envs/base/opt

This allows the user's newly created instance to use any package installed into the above directory as if it was
installed by the user.

.. note::

  NOTE ABOUT UPSTREAM SPACK INSTALLATIONS

  This other instance of Spack has no knowledge of the local Spack instance and may not have the same permissions
  or ownership as the local Spack instance. This has the following consequences:

  - Upstream Spack instances are not locked. Therefore it is up to users to make sure that the local instance is not using an upstream instance when it is being modified.
  - Users should not uninstall packages from the upstream instance. Since the upstream instance doesnâ€™t know about the local instance, it cannot prevent the uninstallation of packages which the local instance depends on.

  See `here <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chain.html#chaining-spack-installations>`_ for more information
  regarding chained Spack instances.

Add Dependencies to the environment
------------------------------------------------

Adding User-Defined Dependencies to the environment
----------------------------------------------------

These can be added to the ``spack.yaml`` by adding to the ``specs`` section.  A dependency that is not already installed
will be built via Spack once the environment is concretized and installed.

.. code-block:: none

  specs:
  - cmake@3.18.2                            ## example from above
  - my_apps_dependency1@version%compiler    ## other explicitly defined specs
  - my_apps_dependency2@version%compiler

Installing the Environment
------------------------------------------------

When in the Spack environment, any packages that are added to the environment file can be installed via:

.. code-block:: none

  > spack concretize -f
  > spack install

Alternatively, a user may install an individual package manually by:

.. code-block:: none

  > spack install <my_app_dependencies@version%compiler>
